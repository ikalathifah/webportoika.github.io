        <p>
          Recent graduate from IPB University with a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics. Now focused on building a career as a Quality 
          Assurance Specialist. I gained hands-on experience during a Quality Assurance Engineer Internship, where I created test cases, documented bugs, 
          reported test results, and joined monthly sprints with developers to validate features. I also completed a QA Automation 
          Bootcamp at Sanbercode and continuously build my skills through online learning platforms like Dicoding and MySkill. 
          Through these experiences, I’ve developed profciency in tools such as JavaScript, Cypress, Playwright, Postman, and task 
          management using Notion. With a passion for continuous learning, I’m eager to contribute to delivering high-quality, reliable 
          software solutions.
